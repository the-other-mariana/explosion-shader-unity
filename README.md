# Volumetric Explosion Shader for Unity 3D

Unity Shader that emulates a volumetric explosion of a sphere. There are 3 shaders involved: a vertex/fragment shader that handles the color and shape of the sphere using layered perlin noise, a smoke shader and a camera shader that lightens up as the explosion takes place. Implemented in C#.<br />
